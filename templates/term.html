            Engagement Agreements with Professionals<br/><br/>
            The Platform permits you to view the Professional Profiles of Professionals who have registered on our Platform and have chosen to allow you to view their Professional Profiles. If you select a Professional for an Engagement through the Platform, you may separately enter into an agreement with that Professional (e.g., for the provision of services as an independent contractor or as an employee) on such terms and conditions as may be agreed to between you and that Professional ("Engagement Agreement"). For example, the Engagement Agreement may contain (1) a description of the services to be provided by the Professional and the capacity in which the Professional will provide such services (e.g., as an independent contractor or as an employee of Company), (2) payment terms, and (3) any other terms and conditions as communicated between you and the Professional through this Platform or otherwise. You understand that you are engaging directly with the Professional you select and not HaveItAll, and that HaveItAll is not a party to and will be in no way responsible for the performance of either you or the Professional under any Engagement Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, if you and Professional agree that Professional will be engaged as an employee under an Engagement Agreement, you understand and agree that Professional will be solely an employee of yours and not HaveItAll. HaveItAll does not make any representations or warranties of any kind in respect of a Professional or an Engagement Agreement and you acknowledge that HaveItAll is not an agent or representative of you or any Professional. You are responsible for managing, inspecting, accepting and paying for services and deliverables provided under an Engagement Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. You also agree to act in good faith when negotiating and performing your obligations under each Engagement Agreement.<br/><br/>
            Payment Fees<br/><br/>
            In order to access and use any paid features on the Platform, you agree to pay HaveItAll a fee that is equal to an amount as determined by the then current fee schedule that can be found on our Website (the "Fee").

You acknowledge that HaveItAll may choose to provide attribution of your Submissions (e.g., listing your name and city on a Professional or Engagement review that you submit) at our discretion, and that such Submissions may be shared with Professionals and others using our Platform. You further grant HaveItAll the right to pursue at law any person or entity that violates your or HaveItAll's rights in the Submissions by a breach of these Terms of Use.
